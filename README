These are tools to integrate port knocking with ssh and scp for bash.

INSTALL
-------

- run 'make install' as a user to put bash scripts in place
- make sure you source the script in your .bashrc or .bash_profile
  source $HOME/.bashrc.d/portknock

  (I have these lines in .bashrc to do so:

if test -e ~/.bashrc.d
then
  for f in ~/.bashrc.d/*
  do
    source $f
  done
fi

CONFIGURATION
--------------

- create a file in $HOME/.portknock with portknock sequences for your hosts:
  - one line per sequence
  - the first argument is a regexp for the hostname
  - the second argument is a comma-separated list of tcp ports to knock on
  - empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored

- to integrate seamlessly with ssh (for tools like git, ...) you can
  add a section to your .ssh/config file using ProxyCommand:

Host different.my.net
  HostName different.my.net
  ProxyCommand psshproxy %h %p
